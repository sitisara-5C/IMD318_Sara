      This page is one of my favorites to share my many hobbies. These are the things that bring
      me comfort, joy, and a sense of balance. I believe hobbies say a lot about a person, and for me,
      they are how I recharge and express myself.

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>
        Reading give me so much new knowledges. Either it fiction or non-fiction, I love them equally.
        There’s something magical about escaping into a story whether it’s fantasy, 
        mystery, or something that just feels real. Books give me space to breathe 
        and imagine.

      <h3>Journaling</h3>
      <p>
        Journaling is my favorite form of self expression. Decorating pages
        with stickers and doodles helps me calm my thoughts and emotions.
        Since I like to journal I have my own system which each of the journal
        have different content.

          your fears, your dreams, your ambitions, your sorrows, your serendipities.”

      <h3>Solo Dates</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy spending time alone by going to bookstores, cinemas,
        and cafés without feeling rushed. Being alone do not means you
        are lonely. It means you are independent and care about yourself
        more than anyone.
        <blockquote>
          The most exciting, challenging, and significant relationship of all 
          is the one you have with yourself. And if you can find someone to love 
          the you that you love, well, that's just fabulous." 
          — Carrie Bradshaw
