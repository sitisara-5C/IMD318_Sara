        <h3>Primary School</h3>
        <p>
          I began my education at SK Bandar Baru Kuala Selangor and SRA Bandar Melawati. During my time there, 
          I served as a prefect in both schools and actively participated in extracurricular activities such as 
          volleyball and Kalam Jamaie. These experiences helped me build confidence, discipline, and teamwork 
          skills. It was also during these early years that I discovered my love for learning, especially in 
          subjects that encouraged critical and creative thinking. This stage of my life played an important 
          role in shaping my curiosity and interest in understanding the world around me.

        <h3>Boarding School Life</h3>
        <p>
          After completing my UPSR, I was offered the opportunity to continue my studies at <abbr title="Maktab Rendah Sains Mara">MRSM</abbr> Felda Trolak. 
          This phase of my life introduced me to friendships that eventually felt like family. I served as a 
          member of the editorial board as a photographer, and in my final year, I was appointed as an <abbr title="Lembaga Pengurusan Asrama">LPA</abbr>, 
          similar to a hostel prefect, as well as the Leader of Multimedia. Living together in a boarding school 
          environment taught me valuable lessons about responsibility, faith, love, and resilience. The memories 
          I built there are ones I will always cherish.

        <h3>Health Challenge and Change</h3>
        <p>
          After four years at <abbr title="Maktab Rendah Sains Mara">MRSM</abbr> Felda Trolak, I experienced health issues related to writer’s cramp, which 
          required me to transfer to a daily school, <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan">SMK</abbr> Seri Tanjong. Although I felt devastated at first, as 
          it was difficult to leave behind a place and people I deeply cared about, Alhamdulillah, this change 
          allowed me to spend more time with my family and focus on my well-being. I also went through medical 
          treatment, including Botox injections, in hopes of improvement, but when there was no significant change, 
          I slowly learned to accept my condition and adapt to living with it. There were moments when I felt 
          overwhelmed and emotionally drained, but I am grateful that I kept trying to move forward, one step at a 
          time. This phase taught me patience, self-acceptance, and the importance of continuing life with gratitude,
          even when things do not turn out as expected.
          During this time, I learned that life is unpredictable. Sometimes we are
          guided in directions we never expect, and trusting Allah’s plan is part
          of the journey.

        <h3>Diploma and Internship</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I am pursuing my Diploma in Information Management at the Faculty of Information Science, 
          <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Sains Mara">UiTM</abbr> Rembau. This stage of my journey has been filled with challenges, personal growth, and moments 
          of self-doubt that slowly transformed into confidence. Along the way, I learned how to step out of my 
          comfort zone, build meaningful friendships, and adapt to new environments. With patience, consistency, 
          and perseverance, I was grateful to achieve the Dean’s List, which became a reminder that effort and 
          belief in myself truly matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my internship experience at Majlis Perbandaran Kuala Selangor, MPKS, I learned the importance of patience, collaboration, and 
          self-discipline while working with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. One of the most 
          meaningful experiences was participating in a work trip to Majlis Perbandaran Langkawi Bandaraya Pelancongan, sponsored by <abbr title="Majlis Perbandaran Kuala Selangor">MPKS</abbr>, 
          which exposed me to real working environments beyond the classroom. This opportunity allowed me to gain 
          hands-on experience, broaden my understanding of professional responsibilities, and appreciate how teamwork 
          and adaptability play a vital role in real-world settings. These experiences shaped me not only academically,
          but also personally, helping me grow into a more confident and resilient individual.
