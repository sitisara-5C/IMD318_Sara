  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <p>
      Assalamualaikum and hi everyone. I am Sara and welcome to my little corner of the internet.
      This website is a gentle reflection of who I am, a space where I collect pieces of my life,
      my interests, and the things that bring me happiness. Feel free to explore and take some time
      to get to know me better. 🌷
    </p>

    <p>
      I created this website as a personal space that feels calm, sincere, and filled with things I love.
      In a world that moves so quickly, I wanted a place where I could slow down, gather my thoughts,
      and share them in my own way. Here, you will find a mix of my hobbies, interests, and small moments
      that hold meaning for me.
    </p>
